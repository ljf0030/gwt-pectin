#summary Pectin Release Notes

== Next Release ==
  * Added new `FormattedListFieldModel` that allows binding of non-string `ListModels` to `HasValue<Collection<String>>`.
  * Added `TextSplitter` component that converts a `TextBox/TextArea` into a `HasValue<Collection<String>>` based on a regex.
  * Added support for auto commit on `BeanModelProvider` (issue 5).  
  * Added support for dirty tracking on `BeanModelProvider` and the value models it creates (issue 7).
  * Added `FormModel.allFields()` to support bindings like `enable(allFields()).when(..)` (issue 6).
  * Added support for binding metadata visibility to DOM Elements.  This improves integration with `UiBinder`.
  * Added more var-args methods for binding to multiple widgets with one binding.
  * Removed deprecated `BeanPropertySource` interface. 
  * Made `StyleApplicator` abstract and provided two static istances, one that uses `UIObject.addStyleName` and one that uses `UIObject.addStyleDependentName`. 
  * Changed validation style names (as applied by the `StyleApplicator`) from the `validation-error` form to the `validationError` form.
  * Added `ValidationDisplayPanel` and `ValidationDisplayLabel` classes with default css for error, warning and info messages.
  * Changed default watermark style from `watermark` to `pectin-Watermark` and added default css for it.
  * Added some basic validators for lists including `NotEmptyListValidator`, `NoEmptyElementsValidator`, `NoNullElementsValidator`.
  * Fixed bug in `ListFieldValidatorImpl` where validation messages weren't always displayed in the order they were added.

== Release 0.1.3 ==
  * Added initial support for watermarks in !TextBoxes  using the `MetadataPlugin`.
  * Simplified `StyleBinder` interface in inline with issue 3
  * Changed `MetadataBinder.bindVisibility(..)` (and related methods) to `MetadataBinder.bindVisibilityOf(..)`.
  * Updated `MetadataBinder.bindValueOf(..)` to support both enabled and visibility variants.
  * Changed `Function` to operate on a single value and added `ReducingFunction` to operate on a collection of values.
  * Added `ComputedValueModel` that takes a source `ValueModel` and `Function`.
  * Added `ReducingValueModel` that takes a `ReducingFunction` and a collection of source models.
  * General clean up of the computed value models.
  * Simplified computed fields by using `Function` for single source and `ReducingFunction` for multiple source models. 
  * Fixed a bug where calling `AbstractBinder.dispose()` twice was failing
  * Updated build environment to work with Snow Leopard 

== Release 0.1.2 ==
  * Added support for GWT JUnit tests:
     * src/gwt-test/java are run using GWT JUnit infrastructure.
     * src/test/java are run using TestNG.
  * Updated `BeanModelProvider` to throw more specific exceptions when accessing bean properties instead of the generic `IllegalStateException` and friends.
  * Deprecated `BeanPropertySource` interface as it's no longer required for deferred binding (a hangover from earlier prototypes).
  * Exposed the `validate` and `runValidators` methods on the various `FieldValidator` interfaces and implementations.
  * Renamed `PluginCallback` to `BindingCallback`.
  * Javadoc updates.

== Release 0.1.1 ==
  * Removed inner classes from builders to simplify code completion options.
  * Added support for bindings values, validation and meta data state to the css style of arbitrary widgets.
  * `IndexedValidationResult` now supports validation messages without an index.
  * `ValueHolder` now always fires `ValueChangeEvents`.  
  * Various bits and pieces.
