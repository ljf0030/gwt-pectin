#summary Guide to Activities

= Activities (Experimental) =

Activities are an experimental addition to pectin to model "things that happen" in a similar ways to Swing's `Action` class.  They implement `Command` and provide states (!ValueModel's) for enabled and active.  The also provide support for interception so view's can confirm actions in an asynchronous manner.  

For now you can checkout the Activities & Buttons tab [http://scratchpad.pietschy.com/pectin/PectinDemo.html on the demo].

The demo has links to the source code.
